/**
 * <h3>A High Dynamic Range (HDR) Histogram</h3>
 * <p>
 * AbstractHistogram supports the recording and analyzing sampled data value counts across a configurable integer value
 * range with configurable value precision within the range. Value precision is expressed as the number of significant
 * digits in the value recording, and provides control over value quantization behavior across the value range and the
 * subsequent value resolution at any given level.
 * <p>
 * For example, a Histogram could be configured to track the counts of observed integer values between 0 and
 * 3,600,000,000 while maintaining a value precision of 3 significant digits across that range. Value quantization
 * within the range will thus be no larger than 1/1,000th (or 0.1%) of any value. This example Histogram could
 * be used to track and analyze the counts of observed response times ranging between 1 microsecond and 1 hour
 * in magnitude, while maintaining a value resolution of 1 microsecond up to 1 millisecond, a resolution of
 * 1 millisecond (or better) up to one second, and a resolution of 1 second (or better) up to 1,000 seconds. At it's
 * maximum tracked value (1 hour), it would still maintain a resolution of 3.6 seconds (or better).
 * <p>
 * The HdrHistogram package includes the {@link org.HdrHistogram.Histogram} implementation, which tracks value counts
 * in <b><code>long</code></b> fields, and is expected to be the commonly used Histogram form.
 * {@link org.HdrHistogram.IntHistogram} and {@link org.HdrHistogram.ShortHistogram}, which track value counts
 * in <b><code>int</code></b> and
 * <b><code>short</code></b> fields respectively, are provided for use cases where smaller count ranges are practical
 * and smaller overall storage is beneficial.
 * <p>
 * HDR Histogram is designed for recoding histograms of value measurements in latency and performance
 * sensitive applications. Measurements show value recording times as low as 3-6 nanoseconds on modern
 * (circa 2012) Intel CPUs. AbstractHistogram maintains a fixed cost in both space and time. A Histogram's memory
 * footprint is constant, with no allocation operations involved in recording data values or in iterating through them.
 * The memory footprint is fixed regardless of the number of data value samples recorded, and depends solely on
 * the dynamic range and precision chosen. The amount of work involved in recording a sample is constant, and
 * directly computes storage index locations such that no iteration or searching is ever involved in recording
 * data values.
 * <p>
 * A combination of high dynamic range and precision is useful for collection and accurate post-recording
 * analysis of sampled value data distribution in various forms. Whether it's calculating or
 * plotting arbitrary percentiles, iterating through and summarizing values in various ways, or deriving mean and
 * standard deviation values, the fact that the recorded data information is kept in high
 * resolution allows for accurate post-recording analysis with low [and ultimately configurable] loss in
 * accuracy when compared to performing the same analysis directly on the potentially infinite series of sourced
 * data values samples.
 * <p>
 * Internally, AbstractHistogram data is maintained using a concept somewhat similar to that of floating
 * point number representation: Using a an exponent a (non-normalized) mantissa to
 * support a wide dynamic range at a high but varying (by exponent value) resolution.
 * AbstractHistogram uses exponentially increasing bucket value ranges (the parallel of
 * the exponent portion of a floating point number) with each bucket containing
 * a fixed number (per bucket) set of linear sub-buckets (the parallel of a non-normalized mantissa portion
 * of a floating point number).
 * Both dynamic range and resolution are configurable, with <b><code>highestTrackableValue</code></b>
 * controlling dynamic range, and <b><code>numberOfSignificantValueDigits</code></b> controlling
 * resolution.
 * <p>
 * An common use example of an HDR Histogram would be to record response times in units of
 * microseconds across a dynamic range stretching from 1 usec to over an hour, with a good enough resolution
 * to support later performing post-recording analysis on the collected data. Analysis can including computing,
 * examining, and reporting of distribution by percentiles, linear or logarithmic value buckets, mean and standard
 * deviation, or by any other means that can can be easily added by using the various iteration techniques supported
 * by the Histogram.
 * In order to facilitate the accuracy needed for various post-recording analysis techniques, this
 * example can maintain where a resolution of ~1 usec or better for times ranging to ~2 msec in magnitude, while at the
 * same time maintaining a resolution of ~1 msec or better for times ranging to ~2 sec, and a resolution
 * of ~1 second or better for values up to 2,000 seconds. This sort of example resolution can be thought of as
 * "always accurate to 3 decimal points." Such an example Histogram would simply be created with a
 * <b><code>highestTrackableValue</code></b> of 3,600,000,000, and a
 * <b><code>numberOfSignificantValueDigits</code></b> of 3, and would occupy a fixed,
 * unchanging memory footprint of around 185KB (see "Footprint estimation" below).
 * <p>
 * <h3>Synchronization and concurrent access</h3>
 * In the interest of keeping value recording cost to a minimum, AbstractHistogram and it's direct implementations
 * are NOT internally synchronized, and do NOT use atomic variables. Callers wishing to make potentially concurrent,
 * multi-threaded updates or queries against Histogram objects should take care to externally synchronize and/or order
 * their access.
 * <p>
 * <h3>Iteration</h3>
 * Histograms supports multiple convenient forms of iterating through the histogram data set, including linear,
 * logarithmic, and percentile iteration mechanisms, as well as means for iterating through each recorded value or
 * each possible value level. The iteration mechanisms are accessible through the {@link org.HdrHistogram.HistogramData}
 * available through  {@link #getHistogramData()}.
 * Iteration mechanisms all provide {@link HistogramIterationValue} data points along the
 * histogram's iterated data set, and are available for the default (corrected) histogram data set
 * via the following {@link org.HdrHistogram.HistogramData} methods:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link HistogramData#percentiles percentiles} : An {@link java.lang.Iterable}<{@link HistogramIterationValue}> through the
 *     histogram using a {@link PercentileIterator} </li>
 *     <li>{@link HistogramData#linearBucketValues linearBucketValues} : An {@link java.lang.Iterable}<{@link HistogramIterationValue}> through
 *     the histogram using a {@link LinearIterator} </li>
 *     <li>{@link HistogramData#logarithmicBucketValues logarithmicBucketValues} : An {@link java.lang.Iterable}<{@link HistogramIterationValue}>
 *     through the histogram using a {@link LogarithmicIterator} </li>
 *     <li>{@link HistogramData#recordedValues recordedValues} : An {@link java.lang.Iterable}<{@link HistogramIterationValue}> through
 *     the histogram using a {@link RecordedValuesIterator} </li>
 *     <li>{@link HistogramData#allValues allValues} : An {@link java.lang.Iterable}<{@link HistogramIterationValue}> through
 *     the histogram using a {@link AllValuesIterator} </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Iteration is typically done with a for-each loop statement. E.g.:
 * <br><code>
 * <pre>
 * for (HistogramIterationValue v : histogram.getHistogramData().percentiles(<i>percentileTicksPerHalfDistance</i>)) {
 *     ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 * </code>
 * or
 * <br><code>
 * <pre>
 * for (HistogramIterationValue v : histogram.getRawHistogramData().linearBucketValues(<i>valueUnitsPerBucket</i>)) {
 *     ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 * </code>
 * The iterators associated with each iteration method are resettable, such that a caller that would like to avoid
 * allocating a new iterator object for each iteration loop can re-use an iterator to repeatedly iterate through the
 * histogram. This iterator re-use usually takes the form of a traditional for loop using the Iterator's
 * <b><code>hasNext()</code></b> and <b><code>next()</code></b> methods:
 *
 * to avoid allocating a new iterator object for each iteration loop:
 * <br>
 * <code>
 * <pre>
 * PercentileIterator iter = histogram.getHistogramData().percentiles().iterator(<i>percentileTicksPerHalfDistance</i>);
 * ...
 * iter.reset(<i>percentileTicksPerHalfDistance</i>);
 * for (iter.hasNext() {
 *     HistogramIterationValue v = iter.next();
 *     ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 * </code>
 * <p>
 * <h3>Equivalent Values and value ranges</h3>
 * <p>
 * Due to the finite (and configurable) resolution of the histogram, multiple adjacent integer data values can
 * be "equivalent". Two values are considered "equivalent" if samples recorded for both are always counted in a
 * common total count due to the histogram's resolution level. Histogram provides methods for determining the
 * lowest and highest equivalent values for any given value, as we as determining whether two values are equivalent,
 * and for finding the next non-equivalent value for a given value (useful when looping through values, in order
 * to avoid double-counting count).
 * <p>
 * <h3>Corrected vs. Raw <b><code>recordValue()</code></b> calls</h3>
 * <p>
 * In order to support a common use case needed when histogram values are used to track response time distribution,
 * Histogram provides for the recording of corrected histogram value by supporting an optional
 * <b><code>expectedIntervalBetweenValueSamples</code></b> parameter to the {@link #recordValue(long, long) recordValue}
 * method. This form is useful in [common load generator] scenarios where response times may exceed the expected interval
 * between issuing requests, leading to "dropped" response time measurements that would typically correlate with
 * "bad" results.
 * <p>
 * When a value recorded in the histogram exceeds the
 * <b><code>expectedIntervalBetweenValueSamples</code></b> parameter (when provided), recorded histogram data will
 * reflect an appropriate number of additional values, linearly decreasing in steps of
 * <b><code>expectedIntervalBetweenValueSamples</code></b>, down to the last value
 * that would still be higher than <b><code>expectedIntervalBetweenValueSamples</code></b>).
 * <p>
 * To illustrate why this corrective behavior is critically needed in order to accurately represent value
 * distribution when large value measurements may lead to missed samples, imagine a system for which response
 * times samples are taken once every 10 msec to characterize response time distribution.
 * The hypothetical system behaves "perfectly" for 100 seconds (10,000 recorded samples), with each sample
 * showing a 1msec response time value. At each sample for 100 seconds (10,000 logged samples
 * at 1msec each). The hypothetical system then encounters a 100 sec pause during which only a single sample is
 * recorded (with a 100 second value).
 * The raw data histogram collected for such a hypothetical system (over the 200 second scenario above) would show
 * ~99.99% of results at 1msec or below, which is obviously "not right". The same histogram, corrected with the
 * knowledge of an expectedIntervalBetweenValueSamples of 10msec will correctly represent the response time
 * distribution. Only ~50% of results will be at 1msec or below, with the remaining 50% coming from the
 * auto-generated value records covering the missing increments spread between 10msec and 100 sec.
 * <p>
 * Data sets recorded with and without an <b><code>expectedIntervalBetweenValueSamples</code></b> parameter will
 * differ only if at least one value recorded with the <b><code>recordValue</code></b> method was greater than it's
 * associated <b><code>expectedIntervalBetweenValueSamples</code></b> parameter.
 * Data sets recorded with an <b><code>expectedIntervalBetweenValueSamples</code></b> parameter will be identical
 * to ones recorded without it if all values recorded via the <b><code>recordValue</code></b> calls were smaller
 * than their associated (and optional) <b><code>expectedIntervalBetweenValueSamples</code></b> parameters.
 *
 * When used for response time characterization, the recording with the optional
 * </code></b>expectedIntervalBetweenValueSamples</code></b> parameter will tend to produce data sets that would
 * much more accurately reflect the response time distribution that a random, uncoordinated request would have
 * experienced.
 * <p>
 * <h3>Footprint estimation</h3>
 * Due to it's dynamic range representation, Histogram is relatively efficient in memory space requirements given
 * the accuracy and dynamic range it covers. Still, it is useful to be able to estimate the memory footprint involved
 * for a given <b><code>highestTrackableValue</code></b> and <b><code>numberOfSignificantValueDigits</code></b>
 * combination. Beyond a relatively small fixed-size footprint used for internal fields and stats (which can be
 * estimated as "fixed at well less than 1KB"), the bulk of a Histogram's storage is taken up by it's data value
 * recording counts array. The total footprint can be conservatively estimated by:
 * <pre><code>
 *     largestValueWithSingleUnitResolution = 2 * (10 ^ numberOfSignificantValueDigits);
 *     subBucketSize = roundedUpToNearestPowerOf2(largestValueWithSingleUnitResolution);

 *     expectedHistogramFootprintInBytes = 512 +
 *          ({primitive type size} / 2) *
 *          (log2RoundedUp((highestTrackableValue) / subBucketSize) + 2) *
 *          subBucketSize
 *
 * </pre></code>
 * A conservative (high) estimate of a Histogram's footprint in bytes is available via the
 * {@link #getEstimatedFootprintInBytes()} method.
